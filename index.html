	<p>We're all just doing the best we can, given our current circumstances.</p>
	<p>If you are going through a difficult time, we hope that you can talk to someone who is curious, caring, and capable of truly hearing you and seeing you. And we hope you can do the same for someone else when they need it.</p>
	<p>Consider this website your empathy buddy, for whenever you need a little help to get through a difficult and important conversation. The phrases are randomized, so keep clicking until you find something that resonates.
