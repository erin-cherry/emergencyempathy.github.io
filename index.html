	<p>You're not alone in your struggle. You deserve validation and empathy when navigating difficult moments. Consider this website your empathy buddy, for whenever you need to be heard, to take a pause, or to transform your thinking.</p>
	<p>The phrases are randomized, however, our hope is that we're able to meet you where you're at - in joy, frustration, curiosity, grief, and the spaces in-between.</p>
	<p>We're all just doing the best we can, given our current circumstances.</p>
